Library Dependences:
======================================================================
*** cfitsio (3.x recommended):
https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html

CFITSIO is a library of C and Fortran subroutines for reading and
writing data files in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data
format.

Using macports, give
sudo port install cfitsio +universal

*** glib2 (2.16 or later):
GTK+, or the GIMP Toolkit, is a multi-platform toolkit for creating
graphical user interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK+ is
suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete
application suites.

using macports give
sudo port install

*** OIFITS (NOT NECESSARY HERE)

OIFITSlib is a C library for input/output, merging, filtering and
checking of optical/IR interferometry datasets in the OIFITS exchange
format. A preprint of the draft specification for OIFITS version 2 is
available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04556 .

The C-library is at
https://github.com/jsy1001/oifitslib


*** fftw3 (v.3.3.6:

FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size,
and of both real and complex data (as well as of even/odd data,
i.e. the discrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST).

*** cmake

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to
build, test and package software.  https://cmake.org

Download at:
https://cmake.org/download/

or with macports:
sudo port install cmake

Commands/Help:
======================================================================
The following commands are available under ./bin
(to see help, just give the command without arguments; for detailed
documentation:
open ./docs/html/index.html
or
open ./docs/latex/refman.pdf
)

* image2uv
Reads an image stored in an input FITS file, calculates
its complex Fourier transform, and stores the resulting
visibility amplitudes and phases in an output FITS file.

* synthimage 
Creates a synthetic static square image from an analytic model
and stores the result in an output FITS file.

* fitscopy 
Copies an input file to an output file, optionally filtering
the file in the process.

* imarith
Perform 'image1 oper image2' or 'image1 oper value'
creating a new output image.

* imcopy
Copy an input image to an output image, optionally compressing
or uncompressing the image in the process.

* imlist
List the the pixel values in a FITS image 

* imstat
Compute statistics of pixels in the input image

* listhead
List the FITS header keywords in a single extension, or, if 
ext is not given, list the keywords in all the extensions. 

* liststruc 
List the structure of a single extension, or, if ext is 
not given, list the structure of the entire FITS file.

* modhead
Write or modify the value of a header keyword.

* tabcalc 
Compute new values for the specified table column using the
input arithmetic expression which may be a function of the 
values in other table columns.

* tablist
List the contents of a FITS table 

* tabmerge
Merge 2 tables by copying all the rows from the 1st table
into the 2nd table.

* tabselect 
Copy selected rows from the input table to the output file
based on the input boolean expression.
