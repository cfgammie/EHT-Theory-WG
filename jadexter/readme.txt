script for calculating chi^2 and rough cut null location and secondary maximum amplitudes from theory images
currently only loads an ASCII format used for ipole images

TODO:
--add some option to self-calibrate LMT to e.g. a Gaussian
--add some option to self-calibrate to the model itself
--add compatibility with eht-imaging fits format
